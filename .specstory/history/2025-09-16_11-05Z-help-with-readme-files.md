_**Assistant**_

I'll help you create both `readme.txt` (for WordPress.org) and `README.md` (for development/GitHub) files. First, let me examine your plugin structure to understand what we're documenting.

            <summary>Listed directory undefined ‚Ä¢ **0** results</summary>

Now let me check which plugin you want documentation for. I see two plugins: `plugin-check` and `theme-reseller-cta`. Let me examine the main plugin files to understand what we're documenting:

Read file: undefined

Read file: undefined

Now let me check the configuration file for the theme-reseller-cta plugin to better understand its functionality:

Read file: undefined

Read file: undefined

Based on my analysis, I can see you have the "Theme Reseller CTA" plugin. Let me create both documentation files for this plugin.
